612. Shortest Distance in a Plane

Table point_2d holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.
| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:
| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
Note: The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.

#Solution:
SELECT ROUND(SQRT(MIN(POWER(L1.x-L2.x, 2) + POWER(L1.y-L2.y,2))),2) AS shortest
FROM point_2d AS L1 
JOIN point_2d AS L2
ON L1.x !=L2.x
OR L2.y !=L2.y
